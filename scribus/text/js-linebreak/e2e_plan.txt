// This script is meant to be run by the browser_subagent.
// It navigates to the demo app, sets justified alignment, and captures a screenshot/inspects canvas.

// Since the demo uses a canvas, we can't easily inspect DOM elements for text position.
// However, the `render` function in `index.html` exposes `result` if we can access it, 
// OR we can visually inspect via screenshot, OR we can inject code to validate.

// The easiest way to validate programmatically is to inject a script that accesses the `LayoutEngine` 
// (or the global scope if exposed) or simply re-runs the logic in the browser context and asserts.
// But the user asked to "do tests in an e2e test on the demo application".
// This implies they want to see the app running.

// Our browser_subagent can "see" via screenshots, but programmatic verification is better.
// The `index.html` is a module, so variables aren't global.
// But we can interact with the inputs.

// Plan:
// 1. Open the page
// 2. Set Alignment to "Justified"
// 3. Set text to something known "A B A B..."
// 4. Click/Trigger render
// 5. Inspect the canvas? No, that's hard. 
// 6. We can check `stats` element which shows "Overflow: Yes/No".
// 7. But we need to verify ALIGNMENT.
//    - Visually: screenshot.
//    - Logic: We can modify `index.html` temporarily to expose the `result` object to window, 
//      then the browser agent can read `window.layoutResult` and verify the `lines` widths.

// Let's modify index.html to expose result.
